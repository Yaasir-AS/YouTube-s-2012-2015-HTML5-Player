# YouTube's 2012-2015 HTML5 Player
This CSS reskins the current YT player to look like what it was between December 2012 and August 2015

This is a sort of update to the original userstyle on USO (Thank you to anyone who installed that

## Installation
Simply go to the user css file and click raw to install it

## Past Update history (from USO)

Update 1: replaced the play button image with a better quality one

Update 1.5: brought back and changed the "Next" button plus the "Previous" button, and changed the volume slider

Update 2: Replaced the god awful 2017 YT logo with the Pre-2017 one, plus a few small changes

Update 2.5: gave the "Theater"/"Default" mode button proper icons (of decent quality) and changed the "Captions" button to look more different

Update 3: similarly to the 2011 player, a user style is added that almost repairs the YouTube player in full screen mode

Update 3.1: I ended up hiding the stream button as that button manages to ruin the 2012 immersion

Update 3.2: Retooled full screen mode

Update 4.1 (AKA THE BIG REWRITE!... part 1):
- Replaced all imgur images for the buttons with ones from an actual atlas of the 2012-2015 (2012-2017 for flash) HTML5 Player
- gave the buttons ":hover" elements present on the 2012 player (even gave the settings and caption buttons their own ":active" elements)
- Made the right-click menu more accurate
- Themed both the Mini Player icon.... and finally (almost), the "Play on TV" icon
- Also made the settings box a little more accurate

Update 4.1.1(AKA THE BIG REWRITE!... part 2):
here it goes.........

-Added the pre-2017 YouTube spinner (That One Spinner With The Dots).... in a way
-brought back the full screen fixes
-Made the YT bezel accurate (in terms of border radius)
-changed the "Play on YouTube button" to be a little more 2012-2015 player accurate (It was actually added in November, but was not documented)

Update 4.1.2:
Made the progress bar centered until further notice due to YT updating the progress bar on the player

Update 4.1.3:
Progress Bar now fills the screen (Though it's kind of broken)

Update 4.1.4:
Progress Bar now fills the screen (Though it might be different depending on your display resolution)

Update 4.1.5:
Sorry for the lack of updates... I simply lost a lot of motivation to work on this project. Anyhow... fixed a problem that should've been posted a long time ago

Update 4.2:
-Scrubber's accurate now. Only took me what..... 4 years?
-Improved the settings box
-Finally fixed full screen mode, for the most part
